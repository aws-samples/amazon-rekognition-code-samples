    "\n",
    "In-person user identity verification is slow to scale, costly, and high friction for users. Machine learning powered facial biometrics can enable online user identity verification. Amazon Rekognition offers pre-trained facial recognition and analysis capabilities that you can quickly add to your user onboarding and authentication work flows to verify opted-in users' identity online. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use the Amazon Rekgonition's key APIs for Identity Verification. After running this notebook you should be able to use the following APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DetectFaces: DetectFaces detects the 100 largest faces in the image. \n",
    "- CompareFaces: Compares a face in the source input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the target input image.\n",
    "- CreateCollection: Creates a searchable index of faces. \n",
    "- IndexFaces: Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection and returns a face id which can be used in subsequent searches. \n",
    "- SearchFacesByImage: For a given input image, first detects the largest face in the image, and then searches the specified collection for matching faces.\n",
    "- SearchFaces: For a given input face ID, searches for matching faces in the collection of the face it belongs to.\n",
    "- DeleteFaces: Deletes faces from a collection. You specify a collection ID and an array of face IDs to remove from the collection.\n",
