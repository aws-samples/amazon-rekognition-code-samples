# Identity Verification

Globally there has been a shift toward “frictionless” digital user experiences. Whether it’s registering at a website, transacting online or simply logging into your bank account, organizations are actively trying to reduce the “friction” their customer’s experience while at the same time enhancing their security, compliance and fraud prevention measures. The shift toward “frictionless” user experiences has given rise to face-based biometric Identity Verification (IDV) solutions aimed at answering “how do you verify a person in the digital world?”.

The following lab modules provide hands on use of Amazon Rekognition APIs for identity verification. These modules were developed to help accelerate facial biometric identification and authorization use cases.
